# AutomationManager

In modern business/enterprise environments, automation has become the driving force to improve products, workflow, and business practices. Managing where, when, and how these automated jobs are implemented and maintained can prove to be an unwieldy task for many. Windows Task Scheduler, SQL Server Agent Jobs, and other custom automation tools each have their own unique user interfaces. WAM (Windows Automation Manager) is a web-based application that will allow users to quickly access scheduled jobs, log information, and a job creation interface to perform a variety of automation tasks within both Windows Task Scheduler and SQL Agent. Through its simplistic and streamlined design, WAM will allow system and network administrators to spend less time monitoring and scheduling tasks, and more time on projects and maintenance.
